# AI-Readiness Notes

## System Modularization

- **Smart Contracts**: Modular interfaces (e.g., IToken.sol) allow AI to auto-generate extensions.
- **Backend API**:
  - Services are dependency-injected to allow AI to swap auth or blockchain layers.
  - Swagger/OpenAPI docs auto-generate SDKs and new endpoints.
- **Frontend**:
  - Reusable typed components (`WalletCard`, `TransactionList`) make it easy for AI to clone or create new UI modules.
- **Docker & CI/CD**:
  - Containerization enables auto-scaling microservice deployment.
  - CI/CD pipelines validate code correctness before deployment, AI can auto-tune based on tests.

## Extensible API Paths

- `/api/staking`: Planned future AI-generated staking endpoints from smart contract interfaces.
- `/api/notifications`: To be added by AI for user alerts.

## AI Cooperation Points

- API documentation to aid prompt-based code generation.
- Code comments tagged with `// TODO: AI-OPTIMIZE` guide AI refactoring.
- Secrets stored via `.env` to avoid hardcoded sensitive info.
